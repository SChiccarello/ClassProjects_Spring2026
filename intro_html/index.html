<h2>How it all started... </h2>
<p>When i was a littl girl, my mom said you could put me in a room with 4 white walls,
    a white ceiling, and  a white floor and my imagination would keep me busy for hours.
 as an adult I turned my imagination towards crafing. One of my first gos at recovery,
someone intorduced me to paint by numbers (I may have an imagination, but getting those
ideas on paper wasn't easy and I"m not good at drawying). As time has passed I've recently
gotten into embroidery/cross stitch. I do a lot of crafting, I'll make a list later with 
some links to informatioan about some of the crafts. </p>

    <h2>Current Project</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working on a cross stitch, the largest, most detailed one I've ever 
        done by hand. It started as being a Christmas gift to my 19 year old step daughter
        who has been obsessed with antiques. She wants her house to look like a nana's house
        when you walk in the door. So she had fell in love with a framed cross stitch of
        stacked teacups while we were shopping at an anituqe mall in the area. I knew I had
        to figure out how to make the pattern or find it. I wound up finding one that got delivered
        the beginning of December so I hadn't had a lot of time. Needless to say I'm still
        working on it and it's going to be her birthday present in March.</p>
