            <h3>Facts About Macaroni Penguins</h3>
            <p>Contrary to ones beliefs, Macaroni Penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) were not named after pasta.
                They were infact named by early English explorers who named the Penguins after young men in 
                the mid 18th century who wore flashy feathers in their hats which was called a macaroni. 
                Macaroni Penguins stand up to 28 inches tall and on average weigh 10 to 12 pounds.The 
                Macaroni Penguins breeding colonies are among the largest and densest of the penguin world
                with up to 100,000 souls. For this reason they have an individualized indentifiable call, that 
                allows its mate and chick to recognize them among rest. They molt once a year replacing all their
                old feathers, this is when they spend 3 to 4 weeks ashore. During that time ashore, the Macaroni 
                Penguin doesn't feed due to not being able to enter the water while featherless. Even with approximately
                100,000 Macaroni Penguins per colony, there has been widespread population declines and their
                conservation status is classifies as vulnerable.</p>

                <h3>The Macaroni Penguins Life Cycle</h3>
                <p>Unlike other penguins, the Macaroni Penguins lays 2 eggs at a time. Often the first egg is
                    significantly smaller out of the two and gets abandoned by the parents so they can focus
                    their energy on the second, much larger egg. For the first 12 days or so both parents will 
                    remain at the nest. For the next 30 days or so they take long, 8 to 12 day shifts incubating
                    the egg for up to 40 days untill it hatches. The female penguin will spend the first 3 to 4
                    weeks of its chicks life bringing food back to the nest while the male stays at the nest.
                    When the chicks are large enough, they gather in groups call creches. Providing the young penguins
                    with safety in numbers and independence, freeing up both parents to return to sea and bring back
                    food for their chicks who are growing faster than ever. Female Macaroni Penguins mature at the age of 5, 
                    6 years old for males. In the wild a Macaroni Penguin can survive for up to 20 years. Due to 
                    predators, pollution and habitat loss, sadly the average is typically 8 to 15 years. With 
                    protection from predators, consistent food and regular veterinary care, a Macaroni penguin 
                    can live for up to 40 years in the safety of a zoo.
